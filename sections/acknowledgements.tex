% AGRADECER!

The work here presented is delivered as final thesis report at Instituto Superior Técnico (IST) in Lisbon, Portugal and it is in partial fulfillment of the European Master in Distributed Computing belonging to promotion of 2011-2013. The Master programme has been composed of a first year at IST, a second year's first semester at Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) and for this work and last academic term, based at the research lab INESC-ID Lisbon with the support of a the scientific grant PTDC/EIA-EIA/108963/2008 as part of a national project (RepComp) funded by FCT Portugal.

%During that period of my life, I have meet very knowledgeable but also amazing people. I am thankful to all of them, even though I can not mention everyone here as it would be unrealistic and unfair. But more than anything, thanks to all of you, colleagues from IST, for following me on the right track to keep things going and moving forward in the best interest of everyone in these two years. Thank you for your kindness and friendship. 
I am mainly thankful to all those who challenged me and pushed me to my limits, without them these experience would not have been the possible and so rewarding.

Special thanks to my advisor and coordinator from the European Master of Distributed Computing Luís Veiga. During my work assignments I also managed to travel to my first conference in United States during February of 2013 to present a partial work of my thoughts in the form of poster and short paper, accepted and presented among many other international candidates at the File And Storage Technologies (FAST 2013) conference in San José, California, as of February of 2013.

I am finally very glad and delighted to have the family that supports me. Thank you for having always been there to support me in tough moment during the last years in general. Key mention to my brother, for having the ability to always making me have a laugh and relax in despite of the most stressing and demanding situation.

Last but not least, to all the professors from IST and KTH that during these last two years challenged me to think out of the box facing always difficulties in despite of any other matters, they taught me to always work towards bigger and better goals. Thank you to Luís Rodrigues, José Monteiro, Paulo Ferreira, João Garcia, Carlos Ribeiro, Miguel Mira Da Silva an Johan Montelius respectively. 

And thank you for your patience administrative staff of the master at IST and KTH, wherever and whoever you are at the time of writing this thesis. I am glad to have been able to meet you all and receive your kindness always positive support.

As a key mention, I would also like to be thankful here to Mr. Lars Hofhansl (larsh@apache.org) from the Apache Foundation, particularly helpful in guiding me in the early stages of this research for directions through the HBase code base and so, I really appreciate his supportive and unselfishness attitude sharing expert advice with me.

\chapter*{Abstract}
\thispagestyle{empty}

Many of today's applications deployed in cloud computing environments make use of key-value storage such as BigTable, Cassandra, and many other no-SQL approaches to overcome scalability limits of relational databases. Relevant open-source solutions include Apache HBase. Several works such as Percolator notify applications whenever data is updated by others (e.g., in the context of updating Google's index). For increased performance and scalability, such storage is partitioned across data centers and each node's data is replicated for availability therefore. Furthermore, fragments of the key-value store should be geo-cached as close as possible to the edge of the network location for increased performance and to reduce the load on mega data centers. This work aims at extending HBase with client-centric caching and replication policies in regards to a consistency model based on data divergence bounds and user-defined application semantics, which we define as Quality-of-Data (QoD). Thus, data stored at QoD-HBase will be kept in the master of a data center with possibly several cached replicas on the slaves region servers. Overall, the data may have different consistency guarantees and synchronizations requirements that will be applicable to inter-replication with other master servers or clusters. This reduces the number of messages and bandwidth needed by master servers to notify applications of data changes and replica updates, while still being able to fulfill those data-defined semantics according to a vector-field consistency QoD paradigm.
