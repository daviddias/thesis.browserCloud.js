\begin{quotation}
"Keep it simple, stupid" K-I-S-S, is an acronym as a design principle noted by the U.S. Navy in 1960. The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complex; therefore simplicity should be a key goal in design and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.
